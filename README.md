# BluWhale Test App

And interactive graph app

## Installation

Clone to repo to your machine and then run `npm install`.

Once the installation is complete, run the command `npm run dev` and then navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser. You should now be able to use the trend viewer.

## Assignment

Assignment

You will have three (3) hours.

Implement a React Component based charting/graphing library. The library should be able to:
• Draw user supplied data at a suitable size onto the page.
• Draw axis and axis ticks showing the ranges.
• Allow the user to specify a chart width and height.
• Allow the user to specify bar chart vs line chart.
• Allow the user to specify the color of the chart. Up to you to define the format (CSS strings, hex, rgb, etc.).
• You can use any method you want to do the actual drawing - svg, canvas, or anything else. You can use an underlying drawing library such as d3 or two.js to do drawing specifics.

The library should be easy to drop into an existing render tree. You may choose whether to expose a monolithic Chart component, or individual components that the user builds up themselves. You may use anything existing online as a reference, but do not just copy and paste an existing library such as Recharts or Victory.

If you finish early, you may tackle any number of stretch goals:
• Mouse tooltips
• Pan/zoom
• Stacked bars
• Responsive charts (automatically resizes as the container resizes)
• Animations
• Scatterplot, area charts, heatmap, etc.

This assignment leaves some room for interpretation. Don't worry about writing it "perfectly to spec"; we care more about what your thought process is and what you choose to prioritize. If you have questions, try to answer them as best you can yourself, and note what you decided in the design document.

To help get you started, you may fork off this codesandbox.io project: https://codesandbox.io/s/bluwhale-fe-6ijhn

Good luck and have fun!

Grading Criteria

• Shows knowledge of React, HTML, CSS, and JS/TS.
• Shows strong skills for writing maintainable, readable code.
• Shows a sensible visual intuition - charts should look acceptable.
• Shows that they know when to trade-off "just get it done" vs "do it carefully".
• Shows an understanding of API design.

Deliverables

1. Source code files.
2. A design document that explains the decisions you made and why.

You can deliver it in a zip, or online as a Github repo, or using an online sandbox like codesandbox.io, repl.it, or stackblitz, glitch.me, etc.
